        <h5>Undergraduate students</h5>
        <p>
            A student can either join one of our projects or propose one that
            fits
            the field of our expertise and interests. In both cases the work
            implies
            researching available literature and being responsible for one's
            project. All undergraduate students must be willing and able to
            commit
            to at least a full year's worth of time in the lab. We expect our
            students to work at least 15 hours per week. If you are interested,
            please contact either <a href="{% url 'team' %}">Mikle Skoblov or
            Ilia Korvigo</a>.
        </p>

        <h5>PhD students and post-docs</h5>
        <p>
            The lab is fairly evenly separated between wet molecular and
            computational divisions. We tend to do things with a "systems
            biology" approach (e.g., field work combined with molecular biology
            and mathematics). We expect
            people to be independent. We are most interested in PhD students and
            experienced post-docs who want to be research fellows. When applying
            for  a position like this, it is important that you choose someone who
            will
            give you a project to "make your own". We are happy to do this, but
            we
            will expect you to take advantage of the opportunity and learn to
            write
            grant applications, give talks, etc. We also expect you to train and
            guide undergraduate students. To schedule an interview contact <a

        <h5>Collaborations</h5>
        <p>
            We are always open for productive and interesting collaborations.
            Please, contact <a href="{% url 'team' %}">
            Mikle Skoblov</a> to discuss the matter.
