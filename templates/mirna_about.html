<h5>Exp-miBR annotator</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> is a web-tool that allows to annotate a VCF-file or single
    position with experimentally confirmed microRNA binding regions (Exp-miBR)
    and their features.
</p>
<br>

<h5>Motivation</h5>
<p class="text-justify">microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs, that accomplish an essential post-transcriptional
    regulation of gene expression. Previously, we showed that commonly used microRNA-mRNA interactions
    predicting software differ from each other substantially, while had a great discrepancy with microRNAs’
    binding regions identified in experiments [1]. Experimentally identified microRNA binding regions
    could be promising as a basis for further queries into not only the fundamental aspects of gene
    regulation but may uncover some new mechanisms caused diseases.
</p>
<br>

<h5>What is exp-miBRs?</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> We have aggregated various experimental data on human microRNA-mRNA
    interactions to identify reliable microRNA binding regions:
</p>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="text-info"> Two existing experiments that had developed and optimized technique protocol to obtain
        full human microRNA-mRNA interactome: CLASH [2] and CLEAR-CLIP [3]. </li>
    <li class="text-info"> 79 AGO2-CLIP-seq data from 9 different cell lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have extracted from these microRNA binding regions only highly reliable regions (Exp-miBRs) that
had a subsequence of length L=10, whereas each nucleotide (position) in this subsequence had been supported
by at least n=2 different datasets or chimeras. <br>
In total, we revealed 46,8 thousand of experimentally confirmed microRNA binding regions,
that were located in all parts of mRNAs, including noncoding regions.
</p>
<br>

<h5>Exp-miBRs features:</h5>
<p class="text-justify"> We characterized each Exp-miBR by the following parameters:
</p>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="text-info"><b> Region information:</b> Genome strand +/- (MIRNA_STRAND), gene name (MIRNA_GENES),
             type of mRNA part (MIRNA_REGION).</li>
    <li class="text-info"><b> Supported dataset characteristics:</b> amount (MIRNA_NDATASET) and list (MIRNA_DATASET)
        of supported experiments (IDs from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) and their corresponding cell
        lines (MIRNA_LINES, MIRNA_NLINES).</li>
    <li class="text-info"><b> Interacted miRNAs</b> (that were detected in CLASH or CLEAR-CLIP experiment as a part of chimeras):
        list of interacted microRNAs (if accessible) (MIRNA).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h5>How it works?</h5>
<h6>Starter on the service:</h6>
<p class="text-justify">There are a few different modes to analyze nucleotide variants location in exp-miBR:
</p>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="text-info"><b> Process a single point:</b> allows you to submit a single point at a time.
        While you can make as many of these submissions as you want. If you have more than a dozen of
        points to process, you should consider the VCF submission form instead.</li>
    <li class="text-info"><b> Process a VCF query:</b> Allow you to upload and process any VCF file (v4.0-4.2),
        though your upload can be no more than 20MB. The file can be compressed by any gzip-compatible
        method (for instance, gzip itself or bgzip). To limit workload, our system only processes the
        first 500k lines from a submitted VCF file (excluding the header lines).
        The output is a bgzipped VCF v4 file. Please, check that your vcf file has a correct
        heading form (you can copy it from example vcf file below).</li>
    <li class="text-info"><b> Download track:</b> Allow you to download all exp-miBRs with their characteristics as a
        separate file. There are separate files for both genome versions (hg19 and hg38).
        Each line in file is corresponded to one exp-miBR.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Interpretation:</h6>
<ol class="list-group">
    <li class="text-info"><b> Variant chr1 40073961:</b> is located in exp-miBR that was supported
        in 3 (MIRNA_NDATASET=3) experiments (MIRNA_DATASET=GSE32113%GSM796037,GSE32113%GSM796038,GSE50452%CLASH).
        These three datasets are corresponded to two different cell lines (MIRNA_NLINES=2; MIRNA_LINES=BC-1,HEK293).
        There is one known interacted microRNA (MIRNA=hsa-miR-320a). This exp-miBR is located in 3 UTR region
        (MIRNA_REGION=UTR3) of PPT1 gene (MIRNA_GENES=PPT1).</li>
    <li class="text-info"><b> Variant chr3 68194389:</b> is not located in any exp-miBRs.</li>
    <li class="text-info"><b> Variant chr7 43876072:</b> is located in exp-miBR that was supported in 2
        (MIRNA_NDATASET=2) experiments (MIRNA_DATASET= GSE28865%GSM714644,GSE28865%GSM714646).
        These two datasets are corresponded to only one cell line (MIRNA_NLINES=1;MIRNA_LINES=HEK293).
        Due to the fact that all supported datasets are AGO-CLIP there is no information about interacted microRNA.
        This exp-miBR is located in 3 UTR region (MIRNA_REGION=UTR3) of PPT1 gene (MIRNA_GENES=URGCP).</li>
